The goal of this program is to output the correct key, given part of a cleartext and the equivalent ciphertext, and the length of the key. If the values are different or if the length of the key is smaller than the given text, the key cannot be found (not actually checked in the code).

To use it, run it via any c# compiler with .net core 2.0, on any platform.

If you want to input custom values, make sure to comment the default given values and uncomment the keyboard input part of the program.
